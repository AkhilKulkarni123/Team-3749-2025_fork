/**
 * Im pretty sure this is where I actually run the trajectories. for that Ineed to figure out two things.
 * 1: is the swerve drive controller OBJECT(Hark- hopefully by end of ENM),
 * 2: is physically running with it (- John and Hark at meeting)
 * 3: is constants to endpoints to see it working in sim( this takes like an minute, but remember to do it correctly)
 * 4: is obvios, robot container button bindings (This is where hopefully it updates states with a push of a button so no need for a seperate sim file, 
 * but if we need one, we can see and it will just go here after this step )
 * 5: SUFFERING to debug it all (Both Hark an John)
